**GREPHY**

To use this version of the GREPHY tool, simply type in the desired regular expression or choose on of the supplied ones. Then, upload your test file containing strings to be matched.

The DOT outputs of the regular expression will be displayed about the character matches. If you would  like to download the files, simply click the corresponding link.

I struggled with matching the strings up with the regular expressions, but I believe the NFA DOT output came out well.

Thank you for using GREPHY!
